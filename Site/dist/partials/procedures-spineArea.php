                                <p>The cervical spine— or neck— is responsible for some pretty important functions. It allows movement of the head and acts as a passageway for major nerves that control arm and leg function. The most common conditions in this region of the spine include disc herniation, disc degeneration, and spinal stenosis.  Any of these conditions can cause neck and shoulder pain, neck stiffness, numbness or tingling in the arms or fingers, and weakness. We can treat most of the conditions without surgery. In the few conditions that do require surgery, amazing advancements have been made, such as artificial disc replacement and microsurgery.</p>

                                <p>The thoracic spine— or middle back— is responsible for the movement of the torso. It is also a passageway for important nerves that affect balance and leg function. The most common conditions in this region of the spine include disc degeneration and stenosis. Spinal tumors may also affect this region. Any of these conditions can cause mid back pain, flank pain, bowel or bladder conditions, or difficulty with balance and walking. Fortunately, many of problems are treated successfully with minimally invasive techniques.</p>

                                <p>The lumbar spine— or low back— is one of the most important regions of the spine. All of the body’s motion and forces are transmitted through this part of the spine. It is the passageway for all the nerves that control leg function and bowel and bladder function. The lumbar spine also allows flexibility and the ability to twist and bend. The most common conditions include disc herniation, disc degeneration, spinal stenosis, tumors, and spinal fractures. Any of these conditions can cause stiffness, pain, numbness or tingling in the legs, difficulty walking or sitting, and even bowel or bladder issues. Nonsurgical and surgical advancements in this region have been staggering. Amazingly, we now treat most of the conditions in the lumbar spine in the outpatient setting using techniques such as artificial disc replacement and microdecompression.</p>

                                <p>The spine can only function properly when all of its regions— cervical, thoracic, lumbar— are in perfect harmony and alignment. The spinal bones or discs can develop structural conditions that disrupt this harmony and this causes deformity of the spine. Deformity most commonly looks like abnormal curvature of the spine, known as scoliosis, or like “hunching” of the spine, known as kyphosis. Minimally invasive deformity correction, computer-assisted surgery, and image-guided surgery have revolutionized our ability to successfully treat these conditions.</p>
