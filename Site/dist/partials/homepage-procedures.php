Any of these conditions can cause neck and shoulder pain, neck stiffness, numbness or tingling in the arms or fingers, and weakness. We can treat most of the conditions without surgery. In the few conditions that do require surgery, amazing advancements have been made, such as artificial disc replacement and microsurgery.</p>

All of the body’s motion and forces are transmitted through this part of the spine. It is the passageway for all the nerves that control leg function and bowel and bladder function. The lumbar spine also allows flexibility and the ability to twist and bend. The most common conditions include disc herniation, disc degeneration, spinal stenosis, tumors, and spinal fractures. Any of these conditions can cause stiffness, pain, numbness or tingling in the legs, difficulty walking or sitting, and even bowel or bladder issues. Nonsurgical and surgical advancements in this region have been staggering. Amazingly, we now treat most of the conditions in the lumbar spine in the outpatient setting using techniques such as artificial disc replacement and microdecompression.</p>
